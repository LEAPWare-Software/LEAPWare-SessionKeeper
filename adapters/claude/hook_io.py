"""Claude Code adapter: translate Claude's hook JSON <-> lwr_core's neutral shapes.

This module does the I/O-adjacent translation ONLY: parsing a dict already
read from stdin into an `Event`, and turning a `Decision` into the dict
Claude Code's hook protocol expects on stdout. It does not read stdin, write
stdout, or call sys.exit — see `plugins/claude/lwr/bin/lwr_hook.py` for the
thin script that does that, so this module stays unit-testable against
fixtures with no subprocess involved.

Claude Code hook JSON shapes referenced here (PreToolUse input, PreToolUse
output's `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`) are documented at
https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks and were cross-checked
against LW-WATCHTOWER's own hook scripts; see docs/install-claude.md for the
exact citations and the sanitized fixtures this adapter is tested against in
tests/adapters/fixtures/claude/.
