"""Policy loading and the fail-open contract.

A policy is plain data: `{"rules": {"<rule_id>": {"mode": "off"|"warn"|"deny", ...}}}`.
This module turns that dict into a `Policy` object the engine can query. It
does NOT read files — `load_policy_dict` takes a dict already parsed by an
adapter (json.load from a file, a bundled default, etc).

Fail-open contract (documented, not incidental): if the policy dict is
missing, malformed, or missing a rule's config entirely, that rule's mode
resolves to "off" and the condition is recorded so an adapter can log it.
SessionKeeper never turns a broken or absent policy file into a deny — a config bug
must not be able to block every dispatch in a session. See
docs/policy.md#fail-open.
