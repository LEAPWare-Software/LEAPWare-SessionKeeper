"""Vendor trees must be committed, not gitignored, and exactly what the build
produces -- not merely non-empty.

A marketplace/plugin install pulls the repo from git with no build step run
afterward (scripts/lwr_build.py never executes on the install path), so
plugins/*/lwr/vendor/ must ship as real, tracked files that are byte-identical
to what scripts/lwr_build.py would write today. This test would have caught
#LWR-D0's first CI break (vendor/ gitignored, no tree for CI to check against)
*and* a narrower regression the first version of this test missed: untracking
a single vendored file (`git rm --cached` one file, leaving it on disk) left
`git ls-files` non-empty, so a truthiness check like `assert tracked` still
passed. This version asserts the *set* of git-tracked paths under each
vendor/ dir equals the *set* scripts/lwr_build.py would produce, one for one.
