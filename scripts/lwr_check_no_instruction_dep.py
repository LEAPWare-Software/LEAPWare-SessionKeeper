"""CI check `lwr-no-instruction-dep`: runtime code never names CLAUDE.md or
AGENTS.md.

Owner directive 3: "The plugin must not depend on any CLAUDE.md or
AGENTS.md (local, project, or global). All policy lives in the plugin."
Those files are contributor-only docs (this repo's own `CLAUDE.md` /
`AGENTS.md` at the root tell a human or CLI which lane to work in) — no
hook, adapter, or engine module may read them or even name them, or a
future edit could quietly grow a real dependency.

Scans every `.py` file under `plugins/`, `core/`, and `adapters/` (this
covers both the source trees and each plugin's vendored copy) for the
literal substrings `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`. This is a literal string
scan, not an AST check, deliberately: it catches a reference inside a
comment or docstring too, since a doc-only reference in a bin/ script is
still a place a future contributor could turn into a real read.

Usage:
    python scripts/lwr_check_no_instruction_dep.py

Stdlib only. Exits 0 and prints "lwr-no-instruction-dep check passed" on
success; otherwise prints every finding (file:line) and exits 1.
