"""Codex adapter: translate Codex's hook JSON <-> lws_core's neutral shapes.

Superseded 2026-09-17 (owner ruling: "Codex supports hooks, so full
enforcement"). The prior reporting-only decision rested on recon that could
not confirm a documented plugin-bundled-hooks manifest shape; a direct fetch
of the canonical docs page confirmed one. Codex's `PreToolUse` hook uses the
SAME `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` (`"allow"` / `"deny"`) shape
Claude Code's does, so `render_decision` below is a straight port of
`adapters/claude/hook_io.py`'s. See docs/install-codex.md for the full
citation trail and quoted source text; sources:
  - https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks (redirects to
    https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks) — hook event/handler/stdin/stdout
    shapes, plugin-bundled hooks via `plugin.json`'s `hooks` field.
  - https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins (redirects to
    https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins) — plugin manifest shape.

This module does the I/O-adjacent translation ONLY, same split as the
Claude adapter: see `plugins/codex/lws/bin/lws_hook.py` for the thin script
that reads stdin / writes stdout / sets the exit code.

`render_report` and the lws-report skill are kept: a human-readable report
is still useful even though the hook itself now enforces mechanically.
