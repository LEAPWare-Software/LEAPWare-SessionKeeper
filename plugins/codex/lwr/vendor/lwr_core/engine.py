"""The pure (event, policy) -> Decision engine.

This module and everything it calls does NO I/O: no file reads, no stdin,
no environment variables, no clock. An adapter builds an `Event` and a
`Policy` from the outside world, calls `evaluate`, and turns the resulting
`Decision` back into its own hook protocol's exit code / JSON shape. That
split is what makes `tests/conformance` meaningful and what keeps a rule
testable without mocking a subprocess.

Rule registry: `RULES` is the list of rule modules the engine consults, in
order. A rule is a plain callable `(Event, RuleConfig) -> Optional[Finding]`;
returning None means "this rule has no opinion on this event". See
`rules/budget_line.py` for the shape and `rules/__init__.py` for the
registry itself. The mutation test in tests/core proves the registry is
load-bearing: remove a rule from it and its deny disappears.
