# lws-report

lws appends one JSON line per evaluated hook event to a ledger file (see
`lws_core/ledger.py` for the record shape: timestamp, hook_event,
tool_name, permit, deny_reason, warnings, findings).

## Locating the ledger

1. Check `LWS_LEDGER_PATH` in the environment; if set, that file is the
   ledger.
2. Otherwise check `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` and look for `ledger.jsonl` under it.
3. Otherwise report that no ledger has been written yet — do not guess a path.

## Reporting

- Read the ledger as newline-delimited JSON; a malformed line is skipped and
  noted, not treated as fatal.
- Group by `permit` (denied vs. allowed) and by `rule_id` inside `findings`.
- For each denial, quote `deny_reason` verbatim — do not paraphrase why a
  dispatch was blocked.
- State the total line count read, so a partial read is never presented as
  the whole history.
