"""lws_core: the shared, adapter-agnostic decision engine for LEAPWare SessionKeeper.

Runtime dependency policy: Python 3.10+ standard library ONLY. No third-party
imports anywhere under core/ or adapters/. Tests may use pytest (dev-only).

Nothing in this package performs I/O. Reading a hook event from stdin,
resolving a policy file from disk, and writing a decision back out are all
adapter concerns (see adapters/claude and adapters/codex). This package only
computes decisions from data already in memory.
